# AI Team - Marvin Learning from Director Patterns

Marvin tracks director's editing patterns during project creation to improve future suggestions for similar projects. He learns time estimate accuracy, preferred task sequences, and typical project structures. This learning makes Marvin progressively more valuable as he calibrates to the director's specific working style.
