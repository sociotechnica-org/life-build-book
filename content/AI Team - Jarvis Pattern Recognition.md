Jarvis identifies patterns across the director's work that might not be consciously recognized, such as category neglect, seasonal energy fluctuations, or completion rate trends. He surfaces these patterns during Council Chamber sessions to inform better planning. His pattern recognition improves over time as he learns the director's unique rhythms.
