# Interface - Warm Neutrals Palette

Warm Neutrals provide the foundational color palette: earth tones, soft grays, and muted backgrounds that create visual calm without feeling clinical. These colors recede during work, allowing content and action to take center stage. Life Category colors remain distinct while harmonizing with this base.
