# Architecture - Council Chamber

The Council Chamber is the first room in the Strategy Studio where directors begin Friday planning with strategic conversation facilitated by Jarvis. This space focuses on big-picture thinking: week-in-review, pattern analysis, Director Attributes assessment, and surfacing what matters most. Category Advisors may join when their domain expertise informs planning.
