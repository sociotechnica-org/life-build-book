# AI Team - Category Advisors Role Pattern

Category Advisors share a common role pattern: they live in their respective domains on the Life Map, provide specialized expertise when consulted, and learn the director's specific situation over time. Each advisor has personality tuned to their domain while maintaining professionalism. They can be summoned by Jarvis during Council Chamber sessions when their domain expertise would inform strategic planning.
