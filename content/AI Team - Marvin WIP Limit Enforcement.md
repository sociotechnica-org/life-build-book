# AI Team - Marvin WIP Limit Enforcement

Marvin enforces work-in-progress limits on kanban boards to prevent context-switching and task thrashing. He warns directors when attempting to exceed limits (maximum 3 tasks in In Progress). This enforcement maintains focus and ensures directors complete tasks rather than starting everything simultaneously.
