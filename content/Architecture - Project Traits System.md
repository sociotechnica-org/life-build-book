# Architecture - Project Traits System

The Project Traits System defines project characteristics through five attributes set during Stage 2 creation: Urgency (time sensitivity), Importance (intrinsic value), Complexity (difficulty), Scale (size/duration), and Support (who's involved). These traits inform system behavior, Marvin's recommendations, and Table position eligibility.
