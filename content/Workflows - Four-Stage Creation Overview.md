# Workflows - Four-Stage Creation Overview

Four-Stage Creation transforms ideas into fully-planned projects ready to activate: Stage 1 Identified (2 min), Stage 2 Scoped (10 min normal/3 min emergency), Stage 3 Drafted (30 min normal/5 min emergency), and Stage 4 Prioritized (5 min normal/2 min emergency). Directors can pause between stages or complete all four in one session.
