# Workflows - Strategize Phase

Strategize phase happens in Council Chamber with Jarvis facilitating strategic conversation. Jarvis presents week-in-review (accomplishments, patterns, Director Attributes trends) and asks questions to surface what matters most. Category Advisors may join when their domain expertise informs planning. Output: clarity on strategic themes for the week.
