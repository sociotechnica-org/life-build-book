# Workflows - Weekly Planning Queue Check

Weekly Planning Queue check happens Friday (5 min): scan for stuck projects (been in Stage 2 for weeks?), complete or abandon projects no longer relevant, advance promising projects through next stage if time available, and keep Planning Queue lean (0-3 projects typically). This prevents Planning Queue from becoming project graveyard.
