Archives Timeline displays browseable history of completed work across all three streams in chronological order with filtering options: by Life Category, date range, project type, stream (Gold/Silver/Bronze), or search terms.

Each completed project appears with urushi image (sculpture for Gold/Silver, dark inked for Bronze), completion date, and quick preview data.
