Search and Filter Archives enables finding past work through multiple access paths: keyword search across project titles and descriptions, filter by Life Category, date range, project archetype, stream (Gold/Silver/Bronze), completion status, or team members involved.

Powerful search helps directors find precedents: "How did I solve similar problem 6 months ago?"
