title: "Completion Rate Tracking"
---

Completion Rate Tracking shows directors' accuracy in predicting capacity over time: week 1 might be 33% (committed to 3, completed 1), week 12 might be 100% (committed to 2, completed 2), week 52 might be 85% sustained accuracy.

This metric measures not productivity but calibration—directors learning to plan realistically for their actual capacity.
