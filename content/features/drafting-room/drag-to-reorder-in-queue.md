title: "Drag to Reorder in Queue"

Drag to Reorder in Queue enables directors to reprioritize work by clicking and holding project cards, dragging up or down to desired position within current view (Full Queue or filtered), and releasing to commit.

Visual feedback shows drop zones. New order determines what's #1 (top candidate) for Friday selection or mid-week promotion.
