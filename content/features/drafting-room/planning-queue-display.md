Planning Queue Display occupies the top section of Drafting Room showing projects moving through Stages 1-3 of creation.

Each project shows urushi image at early stage (Sketch or Foundation), stage indicator ("Stage 2 of 4 - Scoped"), category seal, and last modified date. Directors can click any project to resume work, pause and return later, or abandon projects no longer relevant.
