Priority Queue Display occupies the main section of Drafting Room showing all fully-planned work ready to activate: Plans (Stage 4 complete, never activated) and Paused projects (temporarily stopped).

The queue can be viewed as unified list or filtered by stream (Gold/Silver/Bronze). Paused projects automatically appear at top of their respective filter views.
