title: "Revise Plan Button"

Revise Plan Button returns directors to Drafting Room for adjustments when final review reveals issues: over-commitment, poor category balance, misaligned priorities, or simply changed mind.

No commitment occurs until director is satisfied. This safety valve prevents forcing through questionable plans.
