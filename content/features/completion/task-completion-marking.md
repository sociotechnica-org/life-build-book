title: "Task Completion Marking"
---

Task Completion Marking enables directors to mark individual tasks done via click/swipe in kanban boards or Bronze stack.

Task displays completion checkmark, timestamp, and moves to Done column (kanban) or disappears from Bronze stack. For kanban tasks, progress ring updates immediately. For Bronze tasks, mode-based replacement behavior executes.
