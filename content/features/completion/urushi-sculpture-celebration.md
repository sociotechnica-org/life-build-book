title: "Urushi Sculpture Celebration"
---

Urushi Sculpture Celebration plays when Gold or Silver projects complete: final decoration stage urushi image transforms into commemorative sculpture with gentle animation and subtle sound.

This moment acknowledges significant achievement—transformative frontier-opening work (Gold) or capacity-building infrastructure (Silver). Bronze completions use simpler checkmark animations given volume.
