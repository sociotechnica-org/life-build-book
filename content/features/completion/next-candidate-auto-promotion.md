Next Candidate Auto-Promotion presents option when Gold or Silver projects complete: "Activate [next candidate name] now, or wait until Friday?"

If director confirms immediate activation, top candidate from relevant Priority Queue filter promotes to Work at Hand and appears on The Table. If director defers, slot stays empty until Friday planning.
