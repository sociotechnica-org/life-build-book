ESC to Close Overlay enables fast exit from any overlay or panel via keyboard: Project Boards, settings panels, advisor consultations, Priority Queue filters all close on ESC press.

Directors return to previous view with context preserved—exactly where they were before opening overlay. This provides keyboard alternative to clicking outside or close buttons.
