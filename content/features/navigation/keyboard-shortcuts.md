Keyboard Shortcuts provide instant navigation for keyboard-oriented directors: L (Life Map), S (Strategy Studio), A (Archives), ESC (close current overlay/panel), arrow keys (navigate between items), Enter (open/confirm), Space (toggle/select).

Shortcuts appear subtly on buttons and in help overlay, discoverable without cluttering interface.
