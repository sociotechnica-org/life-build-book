title: "Dual Presence Display"

Dual Presence Display shows Work at Hand projects in two locations simultaneously: on The Table with enhanced visual treatment (enhanced saturation, glow) and on their home Life Category Card with standard Live appearance plus subtle pulse matching Table position color.

This pattern maintains both priority visibility and domain context without choosing between them.
