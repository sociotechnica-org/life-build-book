The Gold Position is the leftmost slot on The Table displaying a single Initiative or Epic-scale project with deep amber/gold color accent and enhanced glow.

When occupied, shows the project's urushi image at final decoration stage. When empty, displays muted outline with "Empty - Strategic Choice" text, acknowledging that intentional emptiness is valid strategy.
