title: "Bronze Stack"
---

The Bronze Stack is the compact visualization of multiple Bronze tasks in the rightmost Table position, appearing as layered cards with visible count and queue depth.

Clicking the stack expands it to show all tasks individually in fan or scrollable view. The stack design communicates operational multiplicity (many discrete tasks) versus Gold/Silver singular focus.
