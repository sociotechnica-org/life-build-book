Three Altitude Navigation enables fluid movement between viewing levels: Overview (all 8 categories), Domain (single category detail), and Execution (Project Board overlay).

Navigation happens via clicking category card backgrounds (Overview → Domain) or project cards (Domain/Overview → Execution). ESC or back returns to previous altitude with context preserved.
