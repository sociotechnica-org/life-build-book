Life Category Cards are the large rectangular containers on the Life Map displaying all projects within each of eight life domains.

Each card shows category name, signature color, Work at Hand projects, Live projects, Maintenance Loop indicators, collapsed Plan stacks, collapsed Paused indicators, and overall activity status. Clicking card background zooms to Domain altitude for detailed view.
