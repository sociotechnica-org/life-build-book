The Table is the persistent priority spotlight displaying Work at Hand across three positions (Gold/Silver/Bronze) at the top of the Life Map.

It occupies approximately 20% of screen height and remains visible at both overview and domain altitudes. The Table ensures directors' weekly priorities stay in peripheral vision during execution regardless of current focus.
