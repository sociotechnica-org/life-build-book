Domain Altitude View zooms single Life Category to fill 80% of screen while keeping The Table visible at top and adjacent categories dimmed around edges.

This altitude provides detailed category view showing all projects, their states, and their relationships while maintaining spatial orientation. Directors can interact with projects and navigate to Project Boards from this view.
