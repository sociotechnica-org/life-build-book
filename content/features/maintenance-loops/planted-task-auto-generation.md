Planted Task Auto-Generation creates new Quick Task projects in Bronze Priority Queue based on Maintenance Loop schedules: system monitors active loops, triggers task creation at scheduled times, tasks appear in Bronze Candidates filter with clear source attribution ("from Meal Planning loop"), and due dates set based on loop configuration.

This automation ensures recurring work surfaces reliably without manual tracking.
