title: "Task Planting Schedule"
---

Task Planting Schedule defines when Maintenance Loops generate new tasks: daily (morning routine), weekly (Sunday meal planning), monthly (first of month budget review), quarterly (seasonal deep cleaning), or custom intervals.

Schedule configuration includes time of day, day of week, specific dates, and advance notice (plant tasks X days before due date for planning buffer).
