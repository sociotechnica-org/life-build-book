title: "Maintenance Loop Creation"
---

Maintenance Loop Creation uses standard four-stage process with additional scheduling step: directors define recurring objectives (Stage 2), create task template that repeats (Stage 3), set recurrence schedule (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly), and prioritize initial activation (Stage 4).

Once activated, loop runs perpetually in background, planting tasks into Bronze Priority Queue on schedule.
