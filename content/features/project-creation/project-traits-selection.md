title: "Project Traits Selection"
---

Project Traits Selection captures five characteristics during Stage 2 that inform system behavior: Urgency (Low/Normal/High/Critical time sensitivity), Importance (Low/Normal/High/Critical intrinsic value), Complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complicated/Complex difficulty), Scale (Micro/Minor/Major/Epic size/duration), and Support (Self/Other Human/AI/Software who's involved).

These traits determine Table position eligibility and Marvin's recommendations.
