title: "Emergency Project Creation"

Emergency Project Creation compresses all four stages into 10-15 minutes for urgent situations: Stage 1 remains 2 minutes (quick capture), Stage 2 reduces to 3 minutes (Marvin auto-suggests), Stage 3 reduces to 5 minutes (template-based task lists), and Stage 4 reduces to 2 minutes (option for immediate activation).

Used for true emergencies and mid-week Work at Hand replacements requiring rapid planning.
