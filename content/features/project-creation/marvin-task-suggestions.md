title: "Marvin Task Suggestions"
---

Marvin Task Suggestions generate initial task lists during Stage 3 based on project objectives, archetype patterns (e.g., Discovery Missions need research tasks), and learned director preferences from past projects.

Marvin organizes tasks by CODAD type (Connect, Operate, Design, Advance, Discover) and sequences by dependencies. Suggestions improve over time as Marvin learns director's working style.
