title: "Stage 3: Drafted Task Generation"
---

Stage 3 Drafted Task Generation creates complete task list through iterative collaboration: Marvin generates initial tasks based on objectives and archetype, directors provide feedback and adjustments, Marvin refines suggestions learning from edits, and process continues until directors are satisfied.

Normal pace takes 30 minutes; emergency pace takes 5 minutes focusing on good-enough-fast rather than perfect.
