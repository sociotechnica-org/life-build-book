title: "Project Archetype Selection"
---

Project Archetype Selection presents seven options during Stage 2: Quick Task (micro/minor one-shot work), Discovery Mission (research/exploration), Critical Response (urgent reactive work), Maintenance Loop (recurring background infrastructure), System Build (leverage-creating infrastructure), Initiative (frontier-opening work), and Epic Project (multi-project chains).

Selection influences Marvin's task suggestions and Priority Queue filter eligibility.
