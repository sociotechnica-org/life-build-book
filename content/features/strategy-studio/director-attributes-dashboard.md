title: "Director Attributes Dashboard"

Director Attributes Dashboard displays current levels for five capacity metrics: Energy Reserve (0-100), Processing Power (0-100), Agency (0-100), Momentum (-50 to +50), and Support Infrastructure (0-100).

These attributes inform capacity-aware planning—Jarvis and Marvin consider these levels when recommending weekly scope. The dashboard helps directors plan realistically rather than aspirationally.
