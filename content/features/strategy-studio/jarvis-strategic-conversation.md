title: "Jarvis Strategic Conversation"

Jarvis Strategic Conversation facilitates directors' big-picture thinking through questions rather than prescriptions: "What are your highest-priority goals this week?" and "What constraints should inform planning?"

Jarvis also surfaces insights from pattern analysis like category neglect or seasonal energy fluctuations. This conversation creates psychological safety for directors to think aloud and revise their thinking.
