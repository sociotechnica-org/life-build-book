Council Chamber is the first Strategy Studio room where Jarvis facilitates strategic conversation during Friday's Strategize phase.

Jarvis presents week-in-review (accomplishments, patterns, Director Attributes trends) and asks questions to surface what matters most for the upcoming week. Category Advisors may join when their domain expertise informs planning.
