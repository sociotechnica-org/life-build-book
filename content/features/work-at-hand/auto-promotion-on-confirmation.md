Auto-Promotion on Confirmation executes when directors click "Confirm Week Plan" in Ready Room: selected Gold/Silver projects receive Work at Hand status, Bronze stack populates based on mode setting, all items appear on The Table, Gold/Silver images complete evolution, kanban boards activate with tasks, and system returns to Life Map.

This single-click action makes weekly plan official.
