title: "Option C: Leave Empty"
---

Option C Leave Empty keeps Table position vacant rest of week when directors pause Work at Hand and choose this option.

Position shows muted outline with "Empty - Strategic Choice" text, freed capacity becomes available for remaining streams or unexpected work, and director reassesses on Friday. Good for energy depletion or intentional simplification.
