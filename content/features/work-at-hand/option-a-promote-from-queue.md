title: "Option A: Promote from Queue"
---

Option A Promote from Queue presents top 3 candidates from relevant Priority Queue filter when directors pause Work at Hand and choose this replacement option.

Director selects one candidate, which immediately activates to Work at Hand status, appears on The Table, and image evolves to decoration stage. Good for when planned work was already prioritized.
