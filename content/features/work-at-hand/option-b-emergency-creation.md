title: "Option B: Emergency Creation"
---

Option B Emergency Creation launches compressed project creation workflow when directors pause Work at Hand and choose this replacement option.

All four stages happen in 10-15 minutes with Marvin auto-suggesting and directors confirming quickly. Project activates to Work at Hand immediately upon Stage 4 completion. Good for unexpected situations requiring immediate action.
