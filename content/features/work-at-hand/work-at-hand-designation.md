title: "Work at Hand Designation"
---

Work at Hand Designation is the status applied to projects and tasks that become weekly priorities, triggering automatic behaviors: appearance on The Table with enhanced visual treatment, image evolution to final decoration stage (Gold/Silver), dual presence display on both Table and home Category Card, and kanban board population with Stage 3 tasks.

This designation transforms Friday selections into persistent visible commitments.
