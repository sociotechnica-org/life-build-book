title: "Bronze Minimal Mode"
---

Bronze Minimal Mode populates stack with only system-driven necessities: tasks with approaching due dates, planted tasks from Maintenance Loops that are due, and small Critical Response items requiring immediate attention.

Stack size varies naturally based on life circumstances (0-50+ tasks). Appropriate for high-energy weeks focused elsewhere or chaotic weeks where necessities are substantial.
