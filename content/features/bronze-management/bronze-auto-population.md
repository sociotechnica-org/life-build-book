title: "Bronze Auto-Population"
---

Bronze Auto-Population maintains stack size based on mode when tasks complete: Minimal mode removes completed task with no replacement (stack shrinks naturally), Target mode auto-populates next Bronze candidate to maintain target count, and Maximal mode auto-populates continuously.

This automatic behavior eliminates manual queue management while respecting director's chosen engagement level.
