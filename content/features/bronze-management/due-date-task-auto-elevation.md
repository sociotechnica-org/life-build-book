Due Date Task Auto-Elevation moves tasks with approaching deadlines (within 2-3 days) to top of Bronze stack regardless of original position or mode.

This ensures urgent work surfaces prominently even when buried in large queues. Marvin flags these tasks with visual urgency indicators. System prevents directors from accidentally ignoring approaching deadlines.
