title: "Bronze Task Reordering"
---

Bronze Task Reordering enables directors to adjust execution sequence by dragging tasks within expanded stack view anytime during week.

Due-date tasks have guardrails (Marvin warns if deprioritizing urgent work). Discretionary tasks fully flexible. Changes persist immediately. Reordering doesn't change mode or count—just tactical sequence.
