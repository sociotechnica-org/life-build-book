title: "Bronze Target Mode"
---

Bronze Target Mode populates stack with Minimal tasks plus X discretionary tasks from Bronze Priority Queue (director sets X, typically +2 to +10).

Discretionary tasks initially slot above due-date tasks; as due dates approach (within 2-3 days), due-date tasks auto-elevate. Good for steadily reducing Bronze queue beyond requirements while maintaining manageable scope.
