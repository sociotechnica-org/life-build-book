title: "Bronze Combo Suggestions"
---

Bronze Combo Suggestions appear when Marvin detects multiple tasks clustering naturally (same location, vendor, type).

Marvin presents optimization: "I can chain these five errands into one driving route taking 90 minutes instead of 3+ hours. Create Combo?" Director confirms or declines. Common combos: driving routes, phone calls to same company, similar purchases.
