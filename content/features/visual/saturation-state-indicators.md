title: "Saturation State Indicators"
---

Saturation State Indicators communicate project status through color intensity: full saturation (100%) for Live projects, dimmed (~60%) for Plans waiting in Priority Queue, very dimmed (~30%) for Paused projects, and enhanced saturation (110%) with glow for Work at Hand.

This consistent visual language enables at-a-glance state recognition.
