title: "Urushi Image Evolution"

Urushi Image Evolution displays project development through five stages inspired by Japanese lacquerware: Sketch (Planning Stages 1-2), Foundation (Planning Stage 3), Color Emergence (Plans), Mirror Polish (Live), and Decoration (Work at Hand/Completed).

Gold and Silver projects evolve through all stages; Bronze tasks remain at Sketch then darken to inked version, reflecting their operational nature.
