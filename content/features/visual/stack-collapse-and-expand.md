title: "Stack Collapse and Expand"
---

Stack Collapse and Expand pattern displays multiple items compactly as "+X" notation (e.g., "+5 Paused", "+12 Plans", Bronze task stack), then expands when clicked to show individual items in fan or scrollable view.

Each item becomes interactive in expanded state. Clicking background or ESC collapses back to compact display, preventing interface clutter.
