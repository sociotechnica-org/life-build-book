title: "Stream Color Accents"

Stream Color Accents apply Gold (deep amber), Silver (cool platinum), or Bronze (warm copper) colors to The Table positions, creating visual distinction between three strategic work streams.

These accents appear on position containers, not projects themselves, reinforcing the portfolio approach to weekly work.
