title: "Progress Rings"
---

Progress Rings are colored borders (3px width, category color +20% brightness) surrounding project cards that fill clockwise as tasks move to Done.

The ring provides at-a-glance progress assessment without opening projects: empty (0%), half-filled (50%), full (100%). Ring color always matches project's Life Category color.
