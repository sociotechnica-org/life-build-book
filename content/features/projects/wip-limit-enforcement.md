title: "WIP Limit Enforcement"
---

WIP Limit Enforcement prevents directors from having more than 3 tasks In Progress simultaneously by displaying Marvin's warning dialog when attempting to add a 4th task.

Marvin suggests completing existing tasks first. Directors can override after seeing warning (rare), and system tracks override patterns to inform capacity conversations with Jarvis.
