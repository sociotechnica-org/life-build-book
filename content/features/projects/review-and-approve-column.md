title: "Review and Approve Column"
---

Review & Approve Column contains tasks submitted by subordinates (Workers, human delegates) awaiting director approval.

Tasks here don't count toward WIP limit since they're blocking on director review. Directors either approve (moves to Done) or request revisions (returns to In Progress with feedback).
