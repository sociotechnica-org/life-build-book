title: "Task Drag and Drop"

Task Drag and Drop enables moving tasks between kanban columns by clicking and holding task cards, dragging to desired column, and releasing to commit.

Visual feedback shows drag state (task lifts, drop zones highlight). This interaction creates tactile feel of moving work through stages.
