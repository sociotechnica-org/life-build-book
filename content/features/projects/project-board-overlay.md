title: "Project Board Overlay"
---

Project Board Overlay appears centered over dimmed Life Map background (30% opacity) when directors click any project card, displaying the full kanban board for task work.

Header shows project name, pause button (if Work at Hand), and close controls. This overlay maintains spatial context—directors always see where they were—while focusing on task execution.
