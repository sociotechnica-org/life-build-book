title: "Project Pause Button"
---

Project Pause Button appears in Project Board headers when projects are Work at Hand, using the project's stream color (gold/silver/bronze accent).

Clicking triggers pause confirmation dialog presenting three replacement options: promote from queue, create emergency project, or leave empty. This enables mid-week adaptation when priorities genuinely shift.
