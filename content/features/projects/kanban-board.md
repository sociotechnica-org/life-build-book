title: "Kanban Board"

Kanban Board organizes every activated project's tasks into four columns: To Do (unlimited, sequenced), In Progress (max 3 tasks, WIP limited), Review & Approve (quality checkpoint), and Done (unlimited, progress visible).

The board provides clear workflow, prevents context-switching through WIP limits, and enables directors to see progress at a glance.
