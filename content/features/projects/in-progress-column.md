title: "In Progress Column"
---

In Progress Column contains tasks currently being actively worked with maximum 3 tasks enforced via WIP limit.

This constraint prevents context-switching and task thrashing. Directors explicitly move tasks here to signal active work, creating clarity about current focus.
