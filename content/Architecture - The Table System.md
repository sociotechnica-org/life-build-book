# Architecture - The Table System

The Table is the persistent priority spotlight occupying 20% of screen height at the top of the Life Map. It displays Work at Hand across three distinct positions (Gold/Silver/Bronze) and remains visible regardless of director's current view. The Table ensures weekly priorities stay in peripheral vision during execution.
