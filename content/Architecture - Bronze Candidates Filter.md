# Architecture - Bronze Candidates Filter

The Bronze Candidates Filter shows only tasks and micro-projects suitable for the Bronze stack: Quick Tasks, planted Maintenance Loop tasks, small Critical Responses, and decomposed work. This filter helps directors set Bronze mode and review operational work. The list is typically 20-100+ tasks.
