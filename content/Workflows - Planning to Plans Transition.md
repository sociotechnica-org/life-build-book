# Workflows - Planning to Plans Transition

Projects transition from Planning to Plans when Stage 4 completes: project exits Planning Queue, enters Priority Queue at appropriate filter position, image evolves from Foundation to Color Emergence (intermediate polish), and appears as dimmed card on home Life Category Card. Now fully planned and ready for Friday selection.
