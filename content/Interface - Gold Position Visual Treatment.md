# Interface - Gold Position Visual Treatment

The Gold position uses deep amber/gold color accent with enhanced glow and subtle breathing animation. When occupied, a single Initiative project appears with its urushi image at full polish. When empty, the position shows muted outline with "Empty - Strategic Choice" text.
