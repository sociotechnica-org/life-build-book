# Interface - Urushi Image Evolution System

Urushi images evolve through five stages inspired by Japanese lacquerware as projects progress through states: Sketch (Planning Stages 1-2), Foundation (Planning Stage 3), Color Emergence (Plans), Mirror Polish (Live), and Decoration (Work at Hand/Completed). This evolution creates sense of projects gaining depth with director investment.
