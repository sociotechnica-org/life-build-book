# Interface - Enhanced Glow and Breathing Animation

Enhanced glow creates subtle luminescence around Table positions using stream-specific colors (amber/platinum/copper). Breathing animation pulses glow intensity between 80-100% over 4-second cycles. This treatment makes Work at Hand feel alive and present without distraction.
