# Interface - Humanist Typography System

Humanist Typography uses letterforms with warmth and personality—typefaces feeling approachable rather than corporate or austere. Clear hierarchy and generous spacing prioritize readability during extended sessions. Typography communicates "this is for humans" at every scale.
