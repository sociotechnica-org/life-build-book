# Interface - Overlay Pattern

Overlay pattern displays centered panels appearing over (not replacing) current view with background dimmed to ~30% opacity. This maintains spatial context—directors always know where they are. Examples include Project Board overlays, advisor consultations, Priority Queue filters, and settings panels. ESC, back button, or click outside to close.
