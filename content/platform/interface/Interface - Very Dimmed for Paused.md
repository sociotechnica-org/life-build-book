# Interface - Very Dimmed for Paused

Paused projects display at approximately 30% opacity to indicate "temporarily stopped" status. This very dimmed treatment distinguishes paused work from both active Live projects and waiting Plans. Projects retain their kanban board state despite visual dimming.
