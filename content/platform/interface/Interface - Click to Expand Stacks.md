# Interface - Click to Expand Stacks

Clicking stacked items ("+5 Plans", Bronze task stack) expands them to show individual items in fan or scrollable view. Each item becomes individually interactive with hover states and click actions. Clicking background or ESC collapses stack back to compact display.
