# Interface - Stacking Pattern

Stacking pattern displays multiple collapsed items with "+X" notation to prevent clutter while preserving awareness. Examples include "+5 Paused" on Category Cards, "+12 Plans" in Priority Queue, "+4 Workers" for assignments, and Bronze stack on The Table. Hover shows subtle glow; click expands to see individual items.
