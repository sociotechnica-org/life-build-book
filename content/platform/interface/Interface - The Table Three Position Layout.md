# Interface - The Table Three Position Layout

The Table displays three distinct positions arranged horizontally: Gold (leftmost), Silver (center), Bronze (rightmost). Each position has dedicated visual treatment (color accents, glows) and occupies equal width. The layout creates clear spatial distinction between three strategic work streams.
