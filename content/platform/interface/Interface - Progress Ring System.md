# Interface - Progress Ring System

Progress rings are colored borders (3px width, category color at +20% brightness) that fill clockwise as tasks move to Done on the kanban board. The ring provides at-a-glance progress assessment: empty ring (0%), half-filled (50%), full ring (100%). Ring color matches project's category color.
