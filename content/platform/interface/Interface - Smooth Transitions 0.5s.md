# Interface - Smooth Transitions 0.5s

All transitions between views use 0.5-second smooth animations: workspace switching, altitude zooming, overlay appearance/disappearance. This timing feels natural—fast enough to maintain flow, slow enough to maintain spatial orientation. No jarring instant changes.
