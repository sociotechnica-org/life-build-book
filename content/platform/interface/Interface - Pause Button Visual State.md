# Interface - Pause Button Visual State

The pause button appears in Project Board headers when projects are Work at Hand, using the project's stream color (gold/silver/bronze accent). Hover shows gentle glow; click triggers pause confirmation dialog with three options (promote from queue, emergency creation, leave empty).
