# Architecture - Strategy Studio Workspace

The Strategy Studio serves as the planning workspace where directors spend Friday planning sessions completing the SOD phases. It consists of four connected rooms arranged left-to-right: Council Chamber, Drafting Room, Roster Room, and Ready Room. This space transforms scattered priorities into structured weekly plans.
