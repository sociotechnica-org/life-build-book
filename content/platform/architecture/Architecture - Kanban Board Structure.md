# Architecture - Kanban Board Structure

The Kanban Board Structure organizes every activated project's tasks into four columns: To Do (unlimited, sequenced by dependencies), In Progress (maximum 3 tasks, WIP limited), Review & Approve (quality checkpoint), and Done (unlimited, visible progress). This structure prevents context-switching while providing clear workflow and progress visibility.
