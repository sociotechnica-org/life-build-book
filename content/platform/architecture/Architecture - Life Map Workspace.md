# Architecture - Life Map Workspace

The Life Map serves as the primary execution workspace where directors spend 80% of their time working on projects and completing tasks. It displays The Table at the top and eight Life Category Cards below in a 3x3 grid. Directors can view at overview altitude (all categories) or zoom to domain altitude (single category).
