# Architecture - Categories Contain Projects

Life Categories are the top-level organizational containers and projects belong to exactly one category. Every project lives in the domain most relevant to its objectives: Health, Relationships, Home, Leisure, Community, Personal Growth, Finances, or Purpose. This hierarchy prevents projects from being organizationally homeless.
