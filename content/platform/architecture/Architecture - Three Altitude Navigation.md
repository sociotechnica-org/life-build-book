# Architecture - Three Altitude Navigation

Three Altitude Navigation enables directors to move between viewing levels: Overview (all 8 categories + The Table), Domain (single category detail), and Execution (Project Board overlay). This navigation pattern maintains spatial awareness while enabling focus. The Table remains visible across Overview and Domain altitudes.
