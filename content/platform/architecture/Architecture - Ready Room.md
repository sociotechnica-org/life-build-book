# Architecture - Ready Room

The Ready Room is the fourth room where directors review their complete weekly plan before activation. Marvin facilitates final review showing The Table preview, category overview, and capacity check. Directors either "Confirm Week Plan" (triggering auto-promotion) or "Revise Plan" (returning to Drafting Room for adjustments).
