# Architecture - Priority Queue System

The Priority Queue contains all fully-planned work ready to activate, waiting for Friday selection. It holds Plans (Stage 4 complete, never activated) and Paused projects (temporarily stopped). The queue supports three-stream filtering to help directors make focused decisions during Friday planning.
