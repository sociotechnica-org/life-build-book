# Architecture - Project Archetypes System

The Project Archetypes System categorizes every project by its work pattern type: Quick Task, Discovery Mission, Critical Response, Maintenance Loop, System Build, Initiative, or Epic Project. Archetype influences how Marvin helps plan projects, where they appear in Priority Queue filters, and whether they're eligible for Gold/Silver/Bronze streams.
