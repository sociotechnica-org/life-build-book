# Workflows - Bronze Mode Switching

Bronze mode switches anytime (not just Friday) via settings gear icon below Bronze position: click gear, select mode (Minimal/Target/Maximal), set Target number if applicable, confirm, and stack updates immediately. Tasks return to or pull from Priority Queue based on new mode. This flexibility supports mid-week capacity adjustments.
