# Workflows - Gold Selection Process

Gold selection views Priority Queue through Gold Candidates filter showing only Initiatives and Epic-scale projects. Directors reorder if needed considering strategic themes from Council Chamber, note which project is #1 (top candidate), and decide whether to activate Gold or leave intentionally empty. Empty Gold is valid strategic choice, not failure.
