# Workflows - Friday Planning Sequence

Friday Planning moves directors through four Strategy Studio rooms in sequence: Council Chamber (strategic conversation with Jarvis, 10-20 min), Drafting Room (priority selection with Marvin, 10-30 min), Roster Room (delegation with Devin, 5-15 min optional), and Ready Room (final confirmation, 5 min). Total investment: 30-70 minutes depending on complexity.
