# Workflows - Weekly Selection Flow

Weekly selection happens Friday in Drafting Room: view Priority Queue through filters (Gold/Silver/Bronze), reorder candidates within each filter if needed, note top selections in each filter, proceed to Ready Room, review complete plan, and click "Confirm Week Plan." This flow transforms Priority Queue candidates into Work at Hand commitments.
