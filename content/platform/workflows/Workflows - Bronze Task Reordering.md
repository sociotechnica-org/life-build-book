# Workflows - Bronze Task Reordering

Directors can reorder Bronze tasks anytime by dragging within expanded stack view. Due-date tasks have guardrails (Marvin warns if deprioritizing urgent work). Discretionary tasks are fully flexible. Changes persist immediately. Reordering doesn't change mode or count—just execution sequence.
