# Workflows - Organize Phase

Organize phase happens in Drafting Room with Marvin facilitating priority selection. Directors view Priority Queue through three filters (Gold/Silver/Bronze), reorder candidates within filters, and select up to one Gold, one Silver, and set Bronze mode. Output: specific weekly commitments across three streams.
