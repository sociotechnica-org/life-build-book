# Workflows - SODA Cycle Overview

The SODA Cycle structures director engagement as weekly rhythm: Strategize, Organize, Delegate, Activate. SOD phases happen Friday in Strategy Studio (planning), then Activate phase runs Saturday-Thursday on Life Map (execution). This cadence creates predictable pattern balancing reflection with action.
