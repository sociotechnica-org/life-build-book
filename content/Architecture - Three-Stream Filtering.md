# Architecture - Three-Stream Filtering

Three-Stream Filtering enables viewing the Priority Queue as Gold Candidates, Silver Candidates, or Bronze Candidates instead of one unified list. This filtering helps directors make focused decisions about fundamentally different types of work. Each filter shows only projects/tasks meeting specific archetype and scale criteria.
