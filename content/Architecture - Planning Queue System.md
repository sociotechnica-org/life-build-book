# Architecture - Planning Queue System

The Planning Queue contains projects in development moving through Stages 1-3 of creation. This temporary workspace allows directors to capture ideas quickly and develop them when ready without immediately prioritizing. Projects graduate from Planning Queue to Priority Queue upon Stage 4 completion.
