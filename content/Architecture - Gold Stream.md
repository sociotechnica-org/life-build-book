# Architecture - Gold Stream

The Gold Stream represents transformative, frontier-opening work through a single Initiative or Epic-scale project displayed in the leftmost Table position. This stream uses deep amber/gold color accents and enhanced glow. The Gold position is often intentionally empty when directors focus on capacity-building or are recovering from major efforts.
