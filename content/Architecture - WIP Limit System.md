# Architecture - WIP Limit System

The WIP Limit System enforces maximum 3 tasks in the In Progress column of any kanban board to prevent context-switching and task thrashing. Marvin warns directors when attempting to exceed limits. This constraint maintains focus and ensures directors complete tasks rather than starting everything simultaneously.
