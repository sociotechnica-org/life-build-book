# Architecture - Silver Stream

The Silver Stream represents capacity-building, leverage-creating work through a single System Build or Discovery Mission displayed in the center Table position. This stream uses cool silver/platinum color accents and enhanced glow. Silver work creates infrastructure that reduces future operational burden and enables more ambitious future Gold work.
