# Architecture - Work at Hand System

Work at Hand is the designation that transforms Friday planning selections into persistent, visible weekly priorities across three strategic streams. Projects and tasks with Work at Hand status appear on The Table with enhanced visual treatment. This system ensures directors focus on their most important work while maintaining flexibility to adapt.
