# Interface - Button Design

Buttons use tactile digital materials with subtle shadows, gentle transitions, and responsive feedback. Primary actions use category colors; secondary actions use warm neutrals. Hover states show gentle glow; active states show slight depression. All buttons communicate pressability through visual depth.
