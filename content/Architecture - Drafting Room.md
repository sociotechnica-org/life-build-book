# Architecture - Drafting Room

The Drafting Room is the second room where directors manage their project pipeline with Marvin. It displays the Planning Queue (top section, Stages 1-3 projects) and Priority Queue (main section, ready-to-activate work with three-stream filtering). This room transforms strategic priorities into tactical weekly commitments.
