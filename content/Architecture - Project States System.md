# Architecture - Project States System

The Project States System tracks projects through their lifecycle from conception to completion: Planning, Plans, Live, Work at Hand, Paused, and Completed. Each state has specific visual treatment, behavioral rules, and allowable transitions. This system provides structure while supporting flexibility.
