# Interface - Drag and Drop Reordering

Drag and drop enables reordering items within Priority Queue filters, Bronze task lists, and kanban board columns. Visual feedback shows drag state (item lifts, drop zones highlight). Reordering commits immediately on drop. Marvin may warn if reordering violates constraints (like deprioritizing urgent due-date tasks).
