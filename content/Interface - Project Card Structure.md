# Interface - Project Card Structure

Project Cards display urushi image (showing evolution stage), progress ring (3px border in category color showing % completion), category seal (small icon), and scale indicators. State determines visual treatment: full saturation for Live, dimmed for Plans, very dimmed for Paused, enhanced for Work at Hand.
