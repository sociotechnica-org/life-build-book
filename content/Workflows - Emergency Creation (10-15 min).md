# Workflows - Emergency Creation (10-15 min)

Emergency pace compresses creation for urgent situations: 2 min Stage 1 (same), 3 min Stage 2 (Marvin auto-suggests), 5 min Stage 3 (good-enough tasks), 2 min Stage 4 (option for immediate activation). Total 10-15 minutes. Used for true emergencies and mid-week Work at Hand replacements requiring rapid planning.
