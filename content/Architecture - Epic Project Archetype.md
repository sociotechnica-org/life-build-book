# Architecture - Epic Project Archetype

Epic Project archetype represents chains of sequenced projects: Discovery Mission leads to Initiatives, leads to System Builds, leads to Maintenance Loops. This architecture may operate behind the scenes (orchestrated by Jarvis and Marvin) or as explicit organizing principle with the director. Epics coordinate large-scale transformation.
