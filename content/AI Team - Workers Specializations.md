# AI Team - Workers Specializations

Workers develop specializations over time based on task types they handle repeatedly: research, writing, data analysis, content creation, and domain-specific work. These specializations make Workers progressively more effective at their assigned work types. Directors can assign tasks to Workers whose specializations match the work required.
