# Workflows - Normal Pace Creation (50 min)

Normal pace spreads creation across days with thoughtful iteration at each stage: 2 min Stage 1, then pause; 10 min Stage 2, then pause; 30 min Stage 3, then pause; 5 min Stage 4. Total 50+ minutes invested in thorough planning. Used for 95% of projects during regular Friday planning.
