# Interface - Life Category Colors

Life Category Colors assign each of the eight categories a signature color that appears as accents throughout the interface: on Category Cards, Project Card borders (3px accent), progress rings, and attribution markers. These colors create visual attribution and help directors quickly identify which life domain contains specific work.
