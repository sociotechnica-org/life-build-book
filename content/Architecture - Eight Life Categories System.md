# Architecture - Eight Life Categories System

The Eight Life Categories divide the director's life into major domains to prevent tunnel vision and ensure whole-life balance. Each category appears as a card on the Life Map grid with its own color, advisor, and project container. The system prevents directors from optimizing only their loudest problems while neglecting other important domains.
