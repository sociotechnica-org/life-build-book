# Architecture - Archives Workspace

The Archives serves as the learning workspace where Conan stores completed projects, historical data, and pattern analysis. Directors visit periodically for reflection, reference, and learning from past work. The Archives enable compound intelligence by preserving hard-won lessons and making them accessible.
