# Workflows - Ready Room Confirmation

Ready Room shows complete weekly plan for final review: Table preview (Gold/Silver/Bronze selections), category overview (work distribution), and capacity check (alignment with Director Attributes). Directors either "Confirm Week Plan" (triggers auto-promotion) or "Revise Plan" (returns to Drafting Room). This pause prevents over-commitment.
