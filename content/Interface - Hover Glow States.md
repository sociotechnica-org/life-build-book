# Interface - Hover Glow States

Hovering over interactive elements triggers subtle glow in appropriate colors: category colors for projects, stream colors for Table positions, warm neutrals for buttons. The glow communicates interactivity without aggressive highlight. Glow fades smoothly on hover exit.
