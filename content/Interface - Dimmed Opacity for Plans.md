# Interface - Dimmed Opacity for Plans

Plans waiting in Priority Queue display at approximately 60% opacity to indicate "fully planned but not yet activated" status. This dimmed treatment creates visual hierarchy between active work (full saturation) and ready-but-waiting work. Projects brighten to full saturation upon activation.
