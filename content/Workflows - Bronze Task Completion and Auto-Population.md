# Workflows - Bronze Task Completion and Auto-Population

Bronze task completion behavior depends on mode: Minimal mode removes task with no replacement (stack shrinks naturally), Target mode auto-populates next Bronze candidate to maintain target count, and Maximal mode auto-populates continuously. Directors click/swipe tasks to mark complete. Stack updates immediately.
