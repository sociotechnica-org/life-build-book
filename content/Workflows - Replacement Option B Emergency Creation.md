# Workflows - Replacement Option B Emergency Creation

Option B creates new project using emergency pace: all four stages compressed (10-15 min total), Marvin auto-suggests based on emergency type, director confirms/adjusts quickly, project immediately activates to Work at Hand upon Stage 4 completion, and appears on The Table. Good for unexpected situations requiring immediate action.
